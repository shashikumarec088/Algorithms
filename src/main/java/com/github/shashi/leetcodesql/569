select id, company, salary from
(select id, company, salary, row_number() over(partition
by company order by salary) as rn,
count(*) over(partition by company) as cnt from Employee)
t1 where (cnt%2 != 0 and round(cnt/2)=rn) or
(cnt%2 = 0 and (round(cnt/2)=rn or ceil(cnt/2+1)=rn))

2nd way

select id,company, salary from
(select id,company, salary, row_number() over(partition by company order by
salary asc, id asc) as rn_asc,row_number() over(partition by company order by
salary desc, id desc) as rn_desc from employee) t1 where rn_asc=rn_desc or
(rn_asc = rn_desc+1 or rn_asc+1 = rn_desc) order by company,salary

3rd way without window
SELECT  min(a.id) as id,a.company,a.salary from employee a,employee b
where a.company = b.company group by a.company,a.salary
having (sum(case when b.salary >=a.salary then 1 else 0 end) >= count(*)/2)
and (sum(case when b.salary <=a.salary then 1 else 0 end) >= count(*)/2)
