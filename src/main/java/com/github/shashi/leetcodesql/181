select e1.name as Employee from employee e1 where e1.salary > (select salary from
employee e2 where e2.id=e1.managerId);


2nd way is comparitively faster as we are using joins in the prev way we are
using the correlated queries
select e1.name as 'Employee' from Employee e1 inner join
Employee e2 on e1.managerId=e2.id and e1.salary>e2.salary;
